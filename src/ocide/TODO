fix build type windows to work properly

1) maybe add 'pins' for watch info similar to what is found in later versions of VS
2) integrate ZIP/UNZIP functionality into the IDE for project rollup
3) add a more modern interface to allow easier docking of the docking windows
4) remember tree expansions...

step into member function
directly show a base class member
this pointer was wrong


debug info for AES.C

autocomplete is confused between structures and regular names

ending brace at end of line
warnings not entirely displayed

debug clean up artifacts on trees

allow drag windows onto the desktop

debug can't parse array elements for [] definition in func header
allow click on tree to change open properties window
hints on property pages

select c++ function name doesn't allow 'operator char()' for example

no ws on startup

redo gui using themes...

smart status bar

--------------------

when displaying types, insert name before []

------------------------------
gui for adding rules...

1) maybe add 'pins' for watch info similar to what is found in later versions of VS
2) integrate ZIP/UNZIP functionality into the IDE for project rollup


remember tree expansions
find window docking
resource window: don't show non-resource subtrees
save bitmaps in multiple formats
hints for variables: show structured info now and allow drilling down
menu & dialog simulator for resources

general properties redraw issues -> allow resize
browse info: browse to constructor, destructor, or operator func
    when selected via -> or .
code completion: completion for non instantiated member functions
code completion: handle ":: " at beginning of global name
code completion: structured return values from functions
code completion: dotstar and pointstar operators
code completion: using statements in nested namespaces...
code completion: namespace-qualifed structure is not completed
debug info:      "->"

debug info/code completion: retest with header files
bug(variable usages window): printf found apparently in inline expansion...


debug info:
    show vtabs?

browse info:
    select function associated with current class?
    class browser?

code completion:
    in structures, don't show base classes (just show the accessible members,
        should this be qualified inside member functions?)
    in structures, show member functions (one entry for each function group should suffice,
            pick the least restrictive for the icon)
    in structures, icons for private, public, protected, functions vs data and member data vs static data

    in functions, allow cycling through list of functions.
    allow parsing full range of C++
    allow for . and -> in functions and filter appropriately
    filter functions when qualified

    function list instead of single function
    hints allow full nesting of vars
public, protect, private
static member
regular member
member function
virtual member function
static member function

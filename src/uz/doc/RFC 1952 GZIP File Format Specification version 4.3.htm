</p><h2>Abstract</h2>

This specification defines a lossless compressed data format that is
compatible with the widely used GZIP utility.  The format includes a
cyclic redundancy check value for detecting data corruption.  The
format presently uses the DEFLATE method of compression but can be
easily extended to use other compression methods.  The format can be
implemented readily in a manner not covered by patents.

<h2><a name="introduction">1. Introduction</a></h2>

<h3><a name="purpose">Purpose</a></h3>

<p>
The purpose of this specification is to define a lossless compressed data
format that:
</p><ul>
<li>
Is independent of CPU type, operating system, file system, and
character set, and hence can be used for interchange;
</li><li>
Can compress or decompress a data stream (as opposed to a
randomly accessible file) to produce another data stream, using only an <i>a
priori</i> bounded amount of intermediate storage, and hence can be used in data
communications or similar structures such as Unix filters;
</li><li>
Compresses data with efficiency comparable to the best currently
available general-purpose compression methods, and in particular considerably
better than the "compress" program;
</li><li>
Can be implemented readily in a manner not covered by patents,
and hence can be practiced freely;
</li><li>
Is compatible with the file format produced by the current
widely used gzip utility, in that conforming decompressors will be able to
read data produced by the existing gzip compressor.
<p>
</p></li></ul>
The data format defined by this specification does not attempt to:
<ul>
<li>
Provide random access to compressed data;
</li><li>
Compress specialized data (e.g., raster graphics) as well as the
best currently available specialized algorithms.
</li></ul>

<h3><a name="audience">Intended audience</a></h3>

<p>
This specification is intended for use by implementors of software to
compress data into gzip format and/or decompress data from gzip format.
</p><p>
The text of the specification assumes a basic background in programming at
the level of bits and other primitive data representations.

</p><h3><a name="scope">Scope</a></h3>

<p>
The specification specifies a compression method and a file format (the
latter assuming only that a file can store a sequence of arbitrary bytes).
It does not specify any particular interface to a file system or anything
about character sets or encodings (except for file names and comments, which
are optional).

</p><h3><a name="compliance">Compliance</a></h3>

<p>
Unless otherwise indicated below, a compliant decompressor must be able to
accept and decompress any file that conforms to all the specifications
presented here; a compliant compressor must produce files that conform to all
the specifications presented here.  The material in the appendices is not
part of the specification per se and is not relevant to compliance.

</p><h3><a name="terms">Definitions of terms and conventions used</a></h3>

<p>
byte: 8 bits stored or transmitted as a unit (same as an octet). (For
this specification, a byte is exactly 8 bits, even on machines which
store a character on a number of bits different from 8.)  See
<a href="#conventions">below</a>
for the numbering of bits within a byte.

</p><h3><a name="changes">1.6. Changes from previous versions</a></h3>

<p>
There have been no technical changes to the gzip format since version
4.1 of this specification.  In version 4.2, some terminology was changed,
and the sample CRC code was rewritten for clarity and to eliminate the
requirement for the caller to do pre- and post-conditioning.
Version 4.3 is a conversion of the specification to RFC style.

</p><h2><a name="specification">2. Detailed specification</a></h2>

<h3><a name="conventions">Overall conventions</a></h3>

In the diagrams below, a box like this:
<pre>+---+
|   | &lt;-- the vertical bars might be missing
+---+
</pre>
represents one byte; a box like this:
<pre>+==============+
|              |
+==============+
</pre>
represents a variable number of bytes.
<p>
Bytes stored within a computer do not have a "bit order", since they are
always treated as a unit.  However, a byte considered as an integer
between 0 and 255 does have a most- and least-significant bit, and since we
write numbers with the most-significant digit on the left, we also write
bytes with the most-significant bit on the left.  In the diagrams below, we
number the bits of a byte so that bit 0 is the least-significant bit,
i.e., the bits are numbered:
</p><p>
</p><pre>+--------+
|76543210|
+--------+
</pre>
<p>
This document does not address the issue of the order in which bits of a
byte are transmitted on a bit-sequential medium, since the data format
described here is byte- rather than bit-oriented.
</p><p>
Within a computer, a number may occupy multiple bytes.  All multi-byte
numbers in the format described here are stored with the least-significant
byte first (at the lower memory address).  For example, the decimal number
520 is stored as:
</p><pre>    0        1
+--------+--------+
|00001000|00000010|
+--------+--------+
 ^        ^
 |        |
 |        + more significant byte = 2 x 256
 + less significant byte = 8
</pre>

<h3><a name="file-format">File format</a></h3>

<p>
A gzip file consists of a series of "members" (compressed data sets).  The
format of each member is specified in the following section.  The members
simply appear one after another in the file, with no additional information
before, between, or after them.

</p><h3><a name="member-format">Member format</a></h3>

Each member has the following structure:
<pre>+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
|ID1|ID2|CM |FLG|     MTIME     |XFL|OS | (more--&gt;)
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
</pre>
(if FLG.FEXTRA set)
<pre>+---+---+=================================+
| XLEN  |...XLEN bytes of "extra field"...| (more--&gt;)
+---+---+=================================+
</pre>

(if FLG.FNAME set)
<pre>+=========================================+
|...original file name, zero-terminated...| (more--&gt;)
+=========================================+
</pre>

(if FLG.FCOMMENT set)
<pre>+===================================+
|...file comment, zero-terminated...| (more--&gt;)
+===================================+
</pre>

(if FLG.FHCRC set)
<pre>+---+---+
| CRC16 |
+---+---+
</pre>

<pre>+=======================+
|...compressed blocks...| (more--&gt;)
+=======================+
</pre>

<pre>  0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
|     CRC32     |     ISIZE     |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
</pre>

<h4><a name="header-trailer">Member header and trailer</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>
ID1 (IDentification 1)
</dt><dd>
</dd><dt>
ID2 (IDentification 2)
</dt><dd>
These have the fixed values ID1 = 31 (0x1f, \037), ID2 = 139 (0x8b,
\213), to identify the file as being in gzip format.
<p>
</p></dd><dt>
CM (Compression Method)
</dt><dd>
This identifies the compression method used in the file.  CM = 0-7
are reserved.  CM = 8 denotes the "deflate" compression method, which is the
one customarily used by gzip and which is documented elsewhere.
</dd><dt>
FLG (FLaGs)
</dt><dd>
This flag byte is divided into individual bits as follows:
<pre>bit 0   FTEXT
bit 1   FHCRC
bit 2   FEXTRA
bit 3   FNAME
bit 4   FCOMMENT
bit 5   reserved
bit 6   reserved
bit 7   reserved
</pre>
<p>
If FTEXT is set, the file is probably ASCII text.  This is an optional
indication, which the compressor may set by checking a small amount of the
input data to see whether any non-ASCII characters are present.  In case of
doubt, FTEXT is cleared, indicating binary data. For systems which have
different file formats for ascii text and binary data, the decompressor can
use FTEXT to choose the appropriate format.  We deliberately do not specify
the algorithm used to set this bit, since a compressor always has the option
of leaving it cleared and a decompressor always has the option of ignoring
it and letting some other program handle issues of data conversion.
</p><p>
If FHCRC is set, a CRC16 for the gzip header is present, immediately before
the compressed data. The CRC16 consists of the two least significant bytes of
the CRC32 for all bytes of the gzip header up to and not including the CRC16.
[The FHCRC bit was never set by versions of gzip up to 1.2.4, even though
it was documented with a different meaning in gzip 1.2.4.]
</p><p>
If FEXTRA is set, optional extra fields are present, as described in a
following section.
</p><p>
If FNAME is set, an original file name is present, terminated by a zero
byte.  The name must consist of ISO 8859-1 (LATIN-1) characters; on
operating systems using EBCDIC or any other character set for file names,
the name must be translated to the ISO LATIN-1 character set.  This is the
original name of the file being compressed, with any directory components
removed, and, if the file being compressed is on a file system with case
insensitive names, forced to lower case. There is no original file name if
the data was compressed from a source other than a named file; for example,
if the source was stdin on a Unix system, there is no file name.
</p><p>
If FCOMMENT is set, a zero-terminated file comment is present.  This comment
is not interpreted; it is only intended for human consumption.  The comment
must consist of ISO 8859-1 (LATIN-1) characters.  Line breaks should be
denoted by a single line feed character (10 decimal).
</p><p>
Reserved FLG bits must be zero.
</p></dd><dt>
MTIME (Modification TIME)
</dt><dd>
This gives the most recent modification time of the original file
being compressed.  The time is in Unix format, i.e., seconds since 00:00:00
GMT, Jan.  1, 1970.  (Note that this may cause problems for MS-DOS and other
systems that use local rather than Universal time.)  If the compressed data
did not come from a file, MTIME is set to the time at which compression
started.  MTIME = 0 means no time stamp is available.
<p>
</p></dd><dt>
XFL (eXtra FLags)
</dt><dd>
These flags are available for use by specific compression methods.
The "deflate" method (CM = 8) sets these flags as follows:
<pre>XFL = 2 - compressor used maximum compression,
          slowest algorithm
XFL = 4 - compressor used fastest algorithm
</pre>
</dd><dt>
OS (Operating System)
</dt><dd>
This identifies the type of file system on which compression took
place.  This may be useful in determining end-of-line convention for text
files.  The currently defined values are as follows:
<pre>  0 - FAT filesystem (MS-DOS, OS/2, NT/Win32)
  1 - Amiga
  2 - VMS (or OpenVMS)
  3 - Unix
  4 - VM/CMS
  5 - Atari TOS
  6 - HPFS filesystem (OS/2, NT)
  7 - Macintosh
  8 - Z-System
  9 - CP/M
 10 - TOPS-20
 11 - NTFS filesystem (NT)
 12 - QDOS
 13 - Acorn RISCOS
255 - unknown
</pre>
</dd><dt>
XLEN (eXtra LENgth)
</dt><dd>
If FLG.FEXTRA is set, this gives the length of the optional extra
field.  See below for details.
</dd><dt>
CRC32 (CRC-32)
</dt><dd>
This contains a Cyclic Redundancy Check value of the uncompressed
data computed according to CRC-32 algorithm used in the ISO 3309 standard
and in section 8.1.1.6.2 of ITU-T recommendation V.42.
(See http://www.iso.ch for ordering ISO documents. See gopher://info.itu.ch
for an online version of ITU-T V.42.)
</dd><dt>
ISIZE (Input SIZE)
</dt><dd>
This contains the size of the original (uncompressed) input data
modulo 2^32.
</dd></dl>

<h5><a name="extra">Extra field</a></h5>

<p>
If the FLG.FEXTRA bit is set, an "extra field" is present in the header, with
total length XLEN bytes.  It consists of a series of subfields, each of the
form:
</p><pre>+---+---+---+---+==================================+
|SI1|SI2|  LEN  |... LEN bytes of subfield data ...|
+---+---+---+---+==================================+
</pre>
SI1 and SI2 provide a subfield ID, typically two ASCII letters with some
mnemonic value.  Jean-Loup Gailly 
<script>mail_to("jloup","gzip.org");</script><a class="link" href="mailto:jloup@gzip.org">&lt;jloup@gzip.org&gt;</a>
is maintaining a
registry of subfield IDs; please send him any subfield ID you wish to use.
Subfield IDs with SI2 = 0 are reserved for future use.  The following IDs
are currently defined:
<pre>SI1         SI2         Data
----------  ----------  ----
0x41 ('A')  0x70 ('P')  Apollo file type information
</pre>
LEN gives the length of the subfield data, excluding the 4 initial bytes.
<p>

</p><h5><a name="id-compliance">Compliance</a></h5>

<p>
A compliant compressor must produce files with correct ID1, ID2, CM, CRC32,
and ISIZE, but may set all the other fields in the fixed-length part of the
header to default values (255 for OS, 0 for all others).  The compressor
must set all reserved bits to zero.
</p><p>
A compliant decompressor must check ID1, ID2, and CM, and provide an error
indication if any of these have incorrect values.  It must examine
FEXTRA/XLEN, FNAME, FCOMMENT and FHCRC at least so it can skip over the
optional fields if they are present.  It need not examine any other part of
the header or trailer; in particular, a decompressor may ignore FTEXT and
OS and always produce binary output, and still be compliant.  A compliant
decompressor must give an error indication if any reserved bit is non-zero,
since such a bit could indicate the presence of a new field that would
cause subsequent data to be interpreted incorrectly.

</p><h2><a name="security">4. Security Considerations</a></h2>

Any data compression method involves the reduction of redundancy in the
data.  Consequently, any corruption of the data is likely to have
severe effects and be difficult to correct.  Uncompressed text, on the
other hand, will probably still be readable despite the presence of
some corrupted bytes.

It is recommended that systems using this data format provide some
means of validating the integrity of the compressed data, such as by
setting and checking the CRC-32 check value.

</p><h2><a name="jl-gzip">7. Appendix: Jean-Loup Gailly's gzip utility</a></h2>

The most widely used implementation of gzip compression, and the original
documentation on which this specification is based, were created by
Jean-Loup Gailly <script>mail_to("jloup","gzip.org");</script><a class="link" href="mailto:jloup@gzip.org">
&lt;jloup@gzip.org&gt;</a>.  Since this implementation is a
de facto standard, we mention some more of its features here.  Again, the
material in this section is not part of the specification per se, and
implementations need not follow it to be compliant.
<p>
When compressing or decompressing a file, gzip preserves the protection,
ownership, and modification time attributes on the local file system, since
there is no provision for representing protection attributes in the gzip
file format itself.  Since the file format includes a modification time, the
gzip decompressor provides a command line switch that assigns the
modification time from the file, rather than the local modification time of
the compressed input, to the decompressed output.
</p><p>

</p><h2><a name="crc-code">8. Appendix: Sample CRC Code</a></h2>

The following sample code represents a practical implementation of the
CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check). (See also ISO 3309 and ITU-T V.42 for a
formal specification.)
<p>
The sample code is in the ANSI C programming language. Non C users may
find it easier to read with these hints:
</p><pre>&amp;      Bitwise AND operator.
^      Bitwise exclusive-OR operator.
&gt;&gt;     Bitwise right shift operator. When applied to an
       unsigned quantity, as here, right shift inserts zero
       bit(s) at the left.
!      Logical NOT operator.
++     "n++" increments the variable n.
0xNNN  0x introduces a hexadecimal (base 16) constant.
       Suffix L indicates a long value (at least 32 bits).

/* Table of CRCs of all 8-bit messages. */

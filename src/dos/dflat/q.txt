Seems fixed. Smile OTOH it seems not to update something correctly - after the switch, a crash usually occurs, immediately or when I try to edit Confused

> File -> Open -> CRASH "Abnormal program termination"

New (?) rare (?) bug : no files visible, only drives and dirs, aborting and retrying helps

- loading a file ... progress indicator: loaded 32'768 from 5'776'229 bytes instead of the odd thing and allow to abort with ESC

Better now Smile

- S&R buggy, allow to abort S&R with ESC

Still very Crying or Very sad buggy, not only with unreasonably huge files, also on UZ.C , can result in:

- Success
- Freezer
- DOS/32A's "null pointer" crash
- "Abnormal" ... yeah

at start (just after leaving the dialog) or when S&R done Confused

Also the S&R dialog is buggy: previous text appears when typing, "bad" usage of DEL key can result in ugly beeps (no further typing possible, at least aborting still works, retry then), some garbage characters

- Syntax highlight select: None ||| C ||| ASM ||| Auto

Done. Very good Smile However S&R seems to mess it up a bit (see shot) - it highlights the garbage instruction Laughing

- Add "ladsoft", version number and exact compilation time into the About box

Done Smile ... One faulty character in the box margin (see shot) ...

<h2>OCC Specifying Include Paths</h2>
<div style="text-align: left;">/Ipath&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; specify include
path.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your file uses headers that aren't in the
directory you are running CC386 from, you will have to tell it what
directory to look in.&nbsp; You can have multiple search directories by
using a semicolon between the directory names.&nbsp; If there are
multiple files with the same name in different directories being
searched, CC386 will use the first instance of the file it finds by
searching the path in order.&nbsp; For example:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OCC /I..\include;..\source;c:\libraries\include
myfile.c<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will search the paths ..\include , ..\source, and
c:\libraries\include in that order.&nbsp; Note that you generally don't
have to specify a path to the OCC compiler header files such as
stdio.h, as that will be taken care of automatically.<br>

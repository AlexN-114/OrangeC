<h2>OMake</h2>
<div style="text-align: left;">OMake currently has no
documentation.&nbsp; OMake is however very similar to GNU make; but it
should be stressed that OMake is not GNU make and there may be
incompatibilities.

One known incompatibility is that OMake is case sensitive, even though it is being
hosted on MSDOS/Windows.  This may be fixed in a future version.

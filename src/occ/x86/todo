Order for the things on my list are:   finish #242, then deal with two pull requests from @chuggafan, then do this and the issue you brought up with adding a build via assembly to the appveyor tests, then fix any issues beyond #242 that chuggafan needs to proceed, then come back to this issue and start working on the most serious problems.  After that I guess I will work with @chuggafan on anything he needs to proceed and then get back to fixing the floating point math problems.

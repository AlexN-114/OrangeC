Info:  'TAILOR' not defined => NOT using any bug workarounds.
This program tests conversions from integer types to floating-point types.
For all types, it test positive powers of 2, e.g., 2**j
For signed types, it also tests negative of positive powers of 2, e.g., -(2**j)
For numbers that are representable, it checks expected value and no exceptions.
This implementation does not claim conformance to IEC-60559 or IEEE-754
Checks of the floating-point exception flags may be meaningless.

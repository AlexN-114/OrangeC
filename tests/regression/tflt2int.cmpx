Info:  'TAILOR' not defined => NOT using any bug workarounds.
This program tests conversions from floating-point types to integer types.
It tests positive powers of 2.0, e.g., f = 2.0**j
It tests both i = +f; and i = -f;
For numbers that are representable, it checks expected value and no exceptions.
For numbers that are NOT representable, it checks for FE_INVALID exception.
This implementation does not claim conformance to IEC-60559 or IEEE-754
Checks of the floating-point exception flags may be meaningless.

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">OGrep</span></h1>
<br>
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">OGrep</span> is a
utility that searches for text within files.&nbsp; It is capable of
matching text with a direct string comparison, with or
without case sensitivity.&nbsp; It also is capable of matching text
within a file against <a href="OGrep%20Regular%20Expressions.html">regular
expressions</a>.&nbsp; Regular expressions
allow a mechanism for specifying ways to match text, while specifying
parts of the text which can vary and still match.&nbsp; For example the
'.' character matches any other character, so a regular expression such
as 'a.c'&nbsp; would match any three-character string starting with 'a'
and ending with 'c'.</span>&nbsp; More powerful matching is also
possible, such as matching sequences of the same character, matching
against any character in a specified set, and so forth.<br>
<br>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Command Line Options</span></h2>
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">The general
format of an <span style="font-weight: bold;">OGrep</span> <a
 href="OGrep%20Command%20Line%20Options.html">command line</a> is as
follows:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">OGrep
[options] match-string list-of-files</span><br
 style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">
</span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">OGrep</span> will search in the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">list-of-files</span> for text that matches
the <span style="font-style: italic;">match-string</span>, and
list file and optionally line number information for each match
found.&nbsp; In
simple cases the match string does not need to be surrounded by quotes,
but in more complex cases involving spacing characters and special
symbols it may be necessary to quote the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">match-string</span>.<br>
<br>
<h2 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align: center;"><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span>Regular Expressions</h2>
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">OGrep</span> has a
powerful <a href="OGrep%20Regular%20Expressions.html">regular
expression</a> matcher, which is turned on by default.&nbsp;
However there is a <a href="OGrep%20Command%20Line%20Options.html">command
line</a> option to disable it.&nbsp; When it is
turned on some characters will not be matched directly against the
text, but will be interpreted in a way that allows the program to
perform abstract types of matches.&nbsp; There are several types of
matching groups:<br>
<br>
</span>
<ul>
  <li>Match a character or sequence of the same character</li>
  <li>Match the start or end of a line</li>
  <li>Match the start, end, or middle of a word</li>
  <li>Match one character out of a set of characters</li>
  <li>A match can be specified to be repeated at another point within
the sequence</li>
</ul>
Some of these matching algorithms can be combined, for example matching
one character out of a set of characters can be combined with matching
a sequence of characters to find words consisting of characters in a
subset of the letters and numbers.<br>
